                        NUS FoodChope, aims to address the severe food wastage problem in 
                        Residential Colleges (RCs) and Halls in NUS. This persistent issue 
                        stems from the mismatch between the amount of meal prepared (meal supply) 
                        and residentsâ€™ demand. Therefore, you can easily play a part by just "booking" 
                        your takeaway meal in advanced through our Ordering System (below!). Doing so, not 
                        just that food operators are better informed of the demands in advanced which 
                        will reduce food wastage from overcooking, you are also able to skip the queue, 
                        better customise your takeaway experience, and save time and Earth at one "Chope"!
