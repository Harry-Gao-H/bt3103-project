                        NUS FoodChope, aims to address the severe food wastage problem in 
                        Residential Colleges (RCs) and Halls in NUS. This persistent issue 
                        stems from the mismatch between the amount of meal prepared (meal supply) 
                        and residentsâ€™ demand. </p>
